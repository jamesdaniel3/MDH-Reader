# MDH-Reader

In this repo, I'm (finally) building a way for Intro CS Head TAs to parse through the office hours data that can be downloaded from my digital hand. Documentation will come as the project is built.

If you are TA looking to use the script, reach out and I can point you to the data files that you need.

If you are TA looking to help with the codebase, see the notes directory, as well as any in-code documentation.

## CAPABILITIES

- Given a TA's name, get the feedback that they have received from students
- Given a student's name or email, get information about all of their trips to office hours

## TODO (order not representative)

- Create a UI, probably just running from terminal for now
- Allow for getting a group of TAs feedback
- Allow for getting all TAs feedback
- Allow for getting a given student's feedback (any TA notes about the student)
- Allow for getting all flagged students (students that TAs have left comments about)
- Allow for output in xlsx and/or sheets
- Allow for auto updating of the data files
- Allow for reading through multiple semesters of data 
- Allow for selecting which semesters of data you want to read through
